## [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* Declarative - React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)

Next.js is a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications. It provides code-splitting and therefore lazy-loading out of the box. It internally takes care of a lot of boilerplate including state transfer and developing react components without the need to take care of rendering environment.

## [Styled JSX](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx)

`style-jsx` is a CSS-in-JS library that removes the mapping between components and styles by allowing us to define our styles within the component itself by utilizing tagged template literals. Thus making components the fundamental way to build a styled UI.

## [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

`tailwind-css` A utility-first CSS framework that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. They make it easy to be consistent with color choices, spacing, typography, shadows, and everything else that makes up a well-engineered design system.

## [NX](https://nx.dev/)

`nx` Nx is a build system with built-in tooling and advanced CI capabilities. It helps you maintain and scale monorepos, both locally and on CI. It comes with the building blocks to scale the monorepo locally and provide great DX while developing.

## [Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/how-amplify-works/)

`Amplify` empowers developers with a flexible collection of modular cloud services and libraries for fullstack application development. Each capability is designed to integrate with the others, while also remaining standalone for customized implementations.
